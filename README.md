# RohitPleaseDrinkYourCoffee
An IoT project designed so my mom doesn't get angry at me for not drinking my coffee
## Purpose
I'm pretty lucky to have a mom that offers to make coffee for me whenever she makes herself a cup. Unfortunately, I'm a very forgetful guy.
After the coffee is made, I usually wait for it to cool down. During which time I'll go sit on my phone somewhere in the house.
After about an hour, I'll realize I didn't get my coffee, at which point I'll not want to drink this old, cold cup of coffee.
So for Christmas 2018, I'm giving my mom the best gift I can: No more wasted cups of coffee.
## Background
Drinking super hot coffee can be dangerous, and if you're McDonald's, it can cost you a couple million in lawsuits.
The ideal serving temperature for any hot beverages is 57.8 degrees C (From https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18226454)
Unfortunately, if you're like me, you can't tell how hot your coffee is beyond "Ow, that's too hot", "That's a good temperature", or "This is cold".
Being able to add some IoT to measure the temperature of your coffee can help this.
